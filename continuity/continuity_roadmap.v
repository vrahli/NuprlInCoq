  In continuity_rule we prove that Brouwer's weak Continuity Principle
  is true using diverging terms as computational effects:
  see lemma [rule_continuity_true] which is a proof that the rule
  [rule_continuity] is true.

  The proof of this rule uses the following meta-result: [continuity_axiom]
  which is in continuity_axiom2.  We go in several steps.  The first and
  final steps use typing in order to add constraints to our terms so that
  we can do the rest of the proof purely computationally.

  The second step is [comp_force_int_app_F_c], which is also in continuity_axiom2,
  and which is the closed version of [comp_force_int_app_F], which is in continuity.

  The third step is [comp_force_int_app_F3_c], which is also in continuity_axiom2,
  and which is the closed version of [comp_force_int_app_F3], which is in continuity3_2.

  The fourth step is [comp_force_int_app_F2_c], which is also in continuity_axiom2,
  and which is the closed version of [comp_force_int_app_F2], which is in continuity2_2.

  These three computational steps use a non-strict lock-step simulation method:

   stronger_continuity_rule4_v3 contains our proof that Brouwer's strong
   Continuity Principle is true: see lemma [rule_strong_continuity_true2_v3_2]
   that proves that rule [rule_strong_continuity2_v3_2] is true.
   In that rule, the existential quantifier that asserts the existence of
   a modulus of continuity function [M] is truncated using [mk_psquash]
   The other (inner) existential is squashed using our regular squash operator
   [mk_squash].

   In stronger_continuity_rule4_v2, we proved the same thing but where
   both existential quantifiers are squashed using [mk_squash].

   Both of these are for sequences from nat to subtypes of nat.
   We have a proof in stronger_continuity_rule4 for functions from nat to nat.

   This strong continuity principle consists of a well-formedness lemma, and
   two conditions.
   The well-formedness lemma is [spM_in_modulus_fun_type_u] in
   stronger_continuity_defs4.
   The first condition is [spM_cond] in stronger_continuity_defs4.
   The second condition is [spM_cond2] in stronger_continuity_rule3.

  In stronger_continuity_props1, we show how to prove that [mk_fresh] is
  a member of a function type: [fresh_in_function].

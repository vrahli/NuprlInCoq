* [DONE] Divide cequiv/approx_star.v into several files, one for each
  non canonical operator so that they can be compiled in parallel.

* not not semantics.

* Move from using rule_true to rule_true3.

* Pointwise functionality vs. pairwise functionality.

* [DONE] Currently, sequences are not allowed in the library: no soseq
  case in SOTerm's definition in terms/sovar.v

* Get rid of the use of functional extensionality and UIP by not using
  all these xxx_proof_irrelevance lemmas.

* [DONE] In the proof of continuity use a squashed relation instead of
  a function.  (We can prove that directly in Nuprl.)

* Get rid of the noatoms in the definition of sequences.

* Bar induction: In bar_induction_sp_rule.v trying to prove a squashed
  bar induction rule that does not mention a separate bar predicate.
  In bar_induction_sp_wf_rule.v, as in bar_induction_sp_rule.v, trying
  to prove a squashed bar induction rule that does not mention a
  separate bar predicate, but because I don't know whether it's going
  to work without assuming that the predicate we're trying to prove is
  well-formed, in the _wf_ version I'm assuming that the predicate is
  well-formed on finite sequences.

* Continuity: In continuity3_ceq.v, trying to prove a more general
  continuity principle for sequences of terms closed under squiggle.

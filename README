====== MAKEFILE ======

To generate a Makefile, run create_makefile.sh.  The script will
generate a Makefile for rules.v and its dependencies.

Then run "make" to see if everything compiles.  It should take a
while.


====== DESCRIPTION ======

This library formalizes Nuprl's Constructive Type Theory (CTT) as of
2015.  CTT is an extensional type theory originally inspired by
Martin-Lof's extensional type theory, and that has since then been
extended with several new types such as: intersection types, union
types, image types, partial types, set types, quotient types, partial
equivalence relation (per) types, simulation and bisimulation types,
an atom type, and the "Base" type.

Our formalization includes a definition of Nuprl's computation system,
a definition of Howe's computational equivalence relation and a proof
that it is a congruence, an impredicative definition of Nuprl's type
system using Allen's PER semantics (using Prop's impredicativity, we
can formalize Nuprl's infinite hierarchy of universes), definitions of
most (but not all) of Nuprl's inference rules and proofs that these
rules are valid w.r.t. Allen's PER semantics, and a proof of Nuprl's
consistency.

In addition to the standard introduction and elimination rules for
Nuprl's types, we have also proved several Brouwerian rules.  Our
computation system also contains: (1) free choice sequences that we
used to prove Bar Induction rules; (2) named exceptions and a "fresh"
operator to generate fresh names, that we used to prove a continuity
rule.

====== ROADMAP =======

o The term definition is in terms.v (see the definition of NTerm).

o The definition of the computation system is in computation.v (see
the definition of compute_step).

o Howe's computational equivalence relation is defined in cequiv.v
(see the definition of cequiv).  This relation is defined in terms of
Howe's approximation relation defined in approx.v (see the definition
approx).  Howe's computational equivalence relation is proved to be a
congruence in approx_star.v

o Types are defined in per.v using Allen's PER semantics.  Universes
are closed under our various type constructor (see the inductive
definition of close).

o Universes and the nuprl type system are defined in nuprl.v.  We've
proved that nuprl is indeed a type system in nuprl_type_sys.v.

o Files such as per_props.v contain proofs of properties of the nuprl
type system.

o The definitions of sequents and rules are in sequents.v.  This file
also contains the definition of what it means for sequents and rules
to be valid.  We also prove in this file that Nuprl is consistent,
meaning that there is no proof of False.

o Our proofs of the validity of Nuprl's inference rules can be
accessed from rules.v (see for example rules_function.v,
rules_squiggle.v).

o Our proof of our Bar Induction rule is in bar_induction3.v

o Our proof of our continuity rule is in continuity_stuff.v.


====== OLD WAY OF DOING THINGS ======

o To generate a Makefile, type:
   coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile



====== OLD OLD WAY OF DOING THINGS (NOW IN oldMakefile) ======

o To compile VPrl make coqdoc-outputs-vo

o If you're using Proof-General, open rules.v and compile the code there.
